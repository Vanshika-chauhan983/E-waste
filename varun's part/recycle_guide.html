       <u> <h2>The 5-Step Process of E-waste Recycling</h2></u>
       <br><br>
        <h3>1. COLLECTING</h3>
        <br>
        <img src="../varun's part/img/collection.jpg">
        <br><br>
        <p>The first step in the e-waste recycling procedure is collecting the e-waste from the pick-up points at specific places where the e-waste is assembled and then transporting it to the organization’s e-waste management center, where the further recycling steps start after this preliminary step.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>2. SORTING</h3>
        <br>

        <br><br>
        <p>After collecting the electronic waste, further is e-waste sorting. Proper separation is the base for the following recycling steps, so sorting and separating e-waste products is important. This process needs labor hands to divide the e-waste according to proper categories for recycling.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>3. EXTRACTIONS AND SEPARATIONS</h3>
        <br>
        <img src="../varun's part/img/extraction.jpg">
        <br><br>
        <p>Separated and sorted e-waste products go for further separation and extraction process, here the different particles get extracted and split, like copper, aluminum, glass, plastic, circuit board, batteries, and sometimes costly and precious metals like gold, silver, copper palladium, etc. are extracted at this stage of the e-waste recycling process. In this stage, a mechanical process is sometimes required with the help of labor.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>4. CLEANING OF WASTE</h3>
        <br>

        <br><br>
        <p>The next step in the recycling process is cleaning the extracted and separated metals. This cleaning process further purifies the metals and extracted products to prepare them for items to be sold.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>5. SALE FOR RE-MANUFACTURING</h3>
        <br>
        <img src="../varun's part/img/sale.jpg">
        <br><br>
        <p>In this step, recycled materials and metals are sold out to the organizations manufacturing the electronic product so that recycled material is used for manufacturing the product. Here the extracted and cleaned recycling product becomes the raw material of manufacturing.</p>

        <u><h2>What is sustainable waste management?</h2></u>
        <br><br>
        <div class="con-img">
        <img src="../varun's part/img/sustainable.jpg">
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>Sustainable waste management aims to keep materials in use for as long as possible and minimize the amount of solid waste that is disposed of in landfill or through incineration. However, in our existing linear economy, waste begins even before products are manufactured, and a more in-depth approach to sustainable waste management must focus on the entire lifecycle of a product to enable us to help reduce the negative environmental, social, and financial impacts of 21st-century consumption.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Placing waste on the hierarchy</h2>
    <div class="hei-img">
        <img src="../varun's part/img/heira.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>Sustainable waste management relies on the waste management hierarchy, a system that focuses on avoidance, reduction, reuse, recycling, energy recovery, and finally, treatment or disposal. It aims to prioritize actions for the most efficient use of resources, placing renewable and less wasteful practices at the top of the pyramid. Here, we look at how the waste management hierarchy is central to sustainable waste management.

    <h2>Why is electronic waste recycling important?</h2>
    <br>
    <div class="re-img">

    </div>
    <br><br>
    <p>Before looking at how electronic waste is recycled, it's important to know why. Sustainable waste management helps to offset the negative impacts of waste while also providing a number of benefits, mainly through keeping materials in circulation.

        Municipalities across the US, and indeed the world, are pushing for greater awareness of the problem and urging businesses across all industries to take greater responsibility for their e-waste products. This has a knock-on effect, and through producer responsibility, consumers have more choice when it comes to recycling (or reusing) e-waste products.
        
        Today, e-waste management is not keeping pace with our consumption, so the importance of recycling e-waste on large scale cannot be underestimated. Unless we improve our management systems, we will soon be surrounded by broken electronics.</p>
